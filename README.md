# 5TSD Start Finance – Assignment
## Assignment background: 
Complete this assignment using the Git, Trello Project Management Software & GitHub. The assignment is a practical exercise which requires students to work together in a team development environment. Each group should have 3 team members.

It focuses to give students with the following experiences:
1.	Project planning and monitoring progress using an agile methodology. 
2.	Team development. Define roles and responsibilities of team members.
3.	Experience the collaborative communication between development members.
4.	Experience the change control & using the version control management tools.
5.	Document the artefacts uses. Setup project official site and wiki.
6.	Develop codes with multiple developers simultaneously and deliver release.
7.	Prepare for software release.

Develop the application under join efforts using the distributed version control client tool and a remote server with the repository hosted in the open source project environment. Other than getting the code developed, students are expected to be able to describe the source control procedures such as branching and merging process in relation to the revision number of their codes.

## Scenario:
ITWorks director would like to further develop an existing open source project so that the employees would be able to use it without cost. The director would like to sponsor the project with minimum costs. He realized that the project is a small and short-term project. ITWorks would like to fork the project and call it as Start_Finance application. The existing application is not a complete product yet. ITWorks has called for open source community members to further develop the application. The director would like to be the product owner and involved in the development process. The project is developed using MS Visual Studio 2015 UWP – C# accessing to the SQLite database. The codes are version controlled and deposited in the repository using a git server.  You are working in ITWorks as a developer. You have also already ganged up some open source team members to develop the Start_Finance application further.

The given application has completed the development on one functional area such as Finance maintenance. The project will be developed further by your team members. The new development is required to include extra functions to maintain the Personal Information, Contact Details, Appointments & Shopping List. Each group member is responsible to develop one of these functional areas (Note: The Finance function has already been done). Given the program in LEARN, you are required to add codes so that each function should be able to perform these core functions: 
* create new records
* update the existing record 
* and delete the existing records

Each team member should confirm one of the following functional area to develop. e.g.
*	Personal Info (e.g. PersonalID, FirstName, LastName, DOB, Gender, Email Address, MobilePhone) 
*	Contact Details (e.g. ContactID, FirstName, LastName, CompanyName, MobilePhone)
*	Appointment info (e.g. AppointmentID, EventName, Location, EventDate, StartTime, EndTime)
*	Shopping List info (e.g. ShoppingItemID, ShopName, NameOfItem, ShoppingDate, PriceQuoted)

The initial application was developed under an open source project in the C# .NET platform.  You may be experiencing the skill differences from an open source project. You can totally rebuild the application to suit your skills so far if it is agreed between your team members. 

Each student must clone the remote repository into the local working folder for development. 

Each student in the group is responsible to develop one of the following functions. Each student must develop their codes in one of the following feature branches simultaneously:

| Feature branches | Tasks to do |
| --- | --- |
| feat_PersonalInfo	| i.e. need a form to maintain (add, update & delete) personal info. |
| feat_ContactDetails |	i.e. need a form to maintain (add, update & delete) contact Details. |
| feat_Appointments |	i.e. need a form to maintain (add, update & delete) the appointments. |
| feat_ShoppingList |	i.e. need a form to maintain the shopping list. |

**Maintain means insert, update and delete the records with the corresponding database table. You also need to take care of the referential integrity of the table structures.
